# Places Family App

This app was developed as a part of the [WWCode App Deploy Hackathon in Partnership with Google Play](https://hopin.com/events/wwcode-app-deploy/registration). The hackathon required participants to build an Android application using a Google API. It took place from 17-20 November 2023.

## ü§î Reflection

This is the first app I've tried building with Android Studio beyond some simple static layout practice exercises, and it's been such a good learning experience!

### üí° Thoughts after Day 1 of hackathon

Whew! I've been plugging away at this little app idea for the first day of the hackathon, and I just wanted to share some thoughts at this point in the process.

‚ú® Sometimes I feel like a true beginner. And other times I feel like I've been working in development for a while.
‚ú® Debugging and troubleshooting, in general, are much easier and less daunting and panic-inducing than they used to be. Solving mysteries is what this is all about.
‚ú® It can take a long time to get things set up/scaffolded/configured, especially when using a new medium.
‚ú® It's exciting to see similarities between web and Android development. Some of the concepts are similar, and it helps knowing a bit about web development to grasp concepts in Android development.
‚ú® Vocabulary is a challenge sometimes. When learning a new domain (Android development in this case), all of the vocabulary is new. So ideas that are the same or similar in web development are called different things. Getting it all straight is a process.
‚ú® Being persistent pays off, in one way or another, eventually.
‚ú® Learning is a continuous process.
